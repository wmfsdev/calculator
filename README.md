TOP: CALCULATOR

Implementing everything learned throughout the Foundations section of TOP.

I expect the calculator UI to be relatively straight forward to implement and I aim to keep
the interface clean and uncomplicated so that I can focus on the code. I can always return to 
the visual design at a later point.

For the code I anticipate to be going back over a lot of ground from the previous project; DOM manipulation - querySelectors and eventListeners for the keys, callbackFunctions for the operations, storing data in the newly learned Object type and array methods.
